BBIPS_Notes ()

echo "This is the ABOUT BBIPS page where I try to explain what the heck bbips is.
Actually, it's just a simple (well, somewhat simple) set of bash functions all
put together in one script with a menu (of sorts) to help you work on batches
(entire directories) of images, all at once. I do some web design, and I like to
take digital pictures, and have thousands of them. While uploading images to
some fancy photogallery software is fine for a few images, I wanted to harness
the power of Linux and Imagemagick to create something that could be run from a
command line on images on a server that didn't use X, and that could run very
fast and without interaction if I wanted it to, or that could accept user input.

Why bash ? Well, because I like bash, and am still learning how to use it, and
it seemed like a good idea at the time. So, while I know of other projects that
do this, I don't know of any that use bash. I could be wrong, there very well
could be a bash script that does all this already, but it's good practical
experience anyway. I've seen some that use perl, some that use c and some that
use python, but never anything very large using bash. Bash comes installed with
almost every major Linux system, so there wouldn't be the need for php, perl,
python, or even the use of a compiler to run it. Just about the only needed
application is Imagemagick. Talk about simple :)

So basically, it's my project I'm doing to learn more about bash and it's limits
and possibilities. I don't claim it to be great programming, but it proved
useful to me on several occasions, so I thought I'd share it. If you like the
program, great, if not, feel free to suggest things or comment on it."

TIP NUMBER 1.

Maximize your shell window. It allows the text to format correctly on your screen
and will make your display show up the way it was intended to.  :)

TIP NUMBER 2.

Create an alias.  The way to do this is to set an alias in your .bashrc
file.  Placing the alias into the .bashrc file allows you to startup bbips simply by 
typing bbips. Below is the way my alias appears at the end of my .bashrc file.

alias bbips='sh /home/crouse/Scripts/bbips/bbips.sh'

You can open up any text editor and edit the .bashrc file. Simply add your alias
line to the end of the file.

Once you have the shell up and running, it's a simple matter of changing
directories and moving into the directory with the images you wish to process.
Then simply type bbips and your up and running in the correct directory. bbips
does contain a way to move up and down in the directory tree, but I find it's
easier for me to just start in the correct directory whenever possible. Making
an alias to the bbips program seems to make it easier for me to find and use.

TIP NUMBER 3.

Work on COPIES of your images. Make a copy of the directory of images you wish to process. 
In case you mess something up, you always have the originals. This isn't a requirement, but
I believe it's just a good practice when working with images.

TIP NUMBER 4.

When working with entire directories of images, it's usually better to have nothing else
in the directory other than the images you wish to process.

TIP NUMBER 5

echo " "
echo "
Major code changes in several functions. Updated version number to .0.4.0

YOUR CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY IS ~~ Made it display bold.

Added several functions to allow for spaces in filenames and directories.
Modified several functions to make use of the command line utilities that were added in.

Fixed some bash coding to make it a bit more elegant. IMHO (Still needs lots of work i know)

list_images function changed to list ONLY jpg's or JPG's

Removed the zip function.

Fixed tar and gzip functions to ONLY include the jpegs.

Image Functions now create directories with useful information at the end of the directory name.
Making it easier to keep track of what you did to the images in that directory.

Fixed bbresize -- removed the -size option... only using -resize now.

# Future things..

# convert -implode from .1% to 2 or 3% (looks best)
# implodes pixels to center 

# convert -swirl 135 DSC04528.JPG DSC04528web.JPG
# swirls pixels x degrees around center

# convert -equalize 
#  perform histogram equalization to the image.

# Will incorporate the use of the command line functions to create
# much more dramatic(better) photogalleries  :) :)
